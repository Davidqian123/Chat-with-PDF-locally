# Nexa AI PDF Chatbot

## Introduction

This demo showcases <strong>Octopus v2</strong>, the first on-device LLM to achieve GPT-4o-level function calling accuracy for AI agents, while operating at <strong>four times the speed</strong> of GPT-4o. We implemented local RAG techniques to transform PDFs into a vector database, enabling seamless querying and answer retrieval. The fine-tuned Octopus v2 model not only summarizes the retrieved answers but also determines and executes the appropriate function calls based on the input context. Additionally, it can generate visualizations, such as charts, based on the generated responses. The demo leverages <strong>AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series Processors</strong> with <strong>CPU + GPU mixed acceleration</strong>, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.
